# Strategy-Game
a strategy game that I have made using Unity for a client on Fiverr as a freelancer.

• The game world is islands, each island has a color. the player needs to take over 
the enemy's island.
• in order to do that players need to enlarge their colony to enlarge their army. he 
needs to create Gold Miner in order to get cold to buy cube lands, buy an army, 
buy an electricity Tower, buy a radar ect .
